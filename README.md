# astal-rs

Rust GIR bindings for astal and astal-* libraries

I left out astal-network because it depends on networkmanager's gobject bindings - which cannot
be generated by `gir` because there are too many bugs in the program.

You have no clue how many bugs I had to patch in `gir` to make this work.

Generating C FFI in Rust is pain
